title: "Cholas sack Anuradhapura."
description: "The island of Sri Lanka faced a series of Chola invasions during the 11th century. It began with Rajaraja Chola I's conquest of Anuradhapura, the island's capital, in 993 CE. This sparked a long conflict. Decades later, Rajaraja's son, Rajendra Chola I, launched another invasion in 1017, aiming to complete his father's work. This brutal campaign included capturing the Sinhalese king and occupying more territory, including the strategic city of Polonnaruwa. Though the Cholas established a presence for decades, they faced resistance, particularly in the south. The island wouldn't be fully under Chola control, and the Sinhalese would eventually win back their independence."
