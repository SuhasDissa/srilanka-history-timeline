The Cholas were a powerful South Indian dynasty that had control over parts of Sri Lanka for some time. The reign of King Vijayabahu I (around 1055 AD), who successfully drove out the Cholas after a long struggle. This win marked a return to independence for the Sinhalese kingdom.

After defeating the Cholas, the Sinhalese king established Polonnaruwa as the new capital. This shift could be due to the strategic location of Polonnaruwa or the desire to move away from the previous capital that might have been damaged during the war.

Theravada Buddhism, the dominant religion in Sri Lanka, requires a continuous lineage of properly ordained monks. Due to the Chola rule, this ordination lineage might have been disrupted. Monks (Bhikkhus) from Pagan, another Theravada Buddhist kingdom in Burma (present-day Myanmar), came to Sri Lanka to help re-establish the proper ordination process. This act ensured the continuation of Theravada Buddhist traditions in Sri Lanka.

Sculptures at Gal Vihara: The Gal Vihara, located near Polonnaruwa, is a famous rock temple complex known for its massive granite sculptures of Buddha.
