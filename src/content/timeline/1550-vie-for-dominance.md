Native Singhalese kings (Rajasinha I, others) and Portuguese puppet king (Dom Jao Dharmapala) vie for dominance.

The Battle of Mulleriyawa, fought in 1559, stands as a pivotal moment in the long-running war between the Sinhalese kingdoms and the Portuguese colonizers. The struggle for power in Sri Lanka fueled the conflict. The Portuguese, led by Jorge de Menezes, sought to expand their control over trade routes and resources, directly challenging the Sinhalese kingdoms' resistance. King Wickramasinghe Mudali of Sitawaka rose to meet this threat.

Historical accounts differ on the exact role of Don Juan Dharmapala in the battle. Some sources suggest he may have been a Sinhalese leader allied with Sitawaka, while others portray him as a Portuguese collaborator. Regardless of his allegiance, the battle itself became a turning point.

Initially, the Sinhalese forces under Wickramasinghe Mudali clashed with the Portuguese in open fields and faced difficulties. However, they cleverly lured the Portuguese into a strategic retreat. Utilizing fortified positions within the marshy terrain of Mulleriyawa, the Sinhalese, likely including forces under Don Juan Dharmapala if he was a Sinhalese ally, repelled repeated Portuguese attacks. This decisive victory inflicted heavy casualties on the Portuguese and established Sitawaka as a major power capable of challenging Portuguese dominance in Sri Lanka.
