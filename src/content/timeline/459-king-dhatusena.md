title: "King Dhatusena"
description: "After been consecrated, Dhatusena built many Viharas and 18 reservoirs including magnificent reservoir “Kala Wewa”. King Dhatusena ordered to produce an interpretation to the Deepavamsa and spent 1,000 gold coins (Kahavanu) for the work. This interpretation to Deepavamsa is considered to be “Mahavamsa”. Mahavamsa is more complete than Deepavamsa since the author Mahathera Mahanama used other older sources other than Deepavamsa. King Dhatusena had two sons (Kassapa and Moggallana) and one daughter. Due to a family problem, King Dhatusena burnt his own sister alive as a punishment. Son of the dead woman, Migara, extremely angered by this incident, banded with Kassapa and plotted against the King. They overpowered King Dhatusena and imprisoned him."
